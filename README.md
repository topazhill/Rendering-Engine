# Rendering-Engine
A simply 3D rendering engine capable of displaying simple shapes. 

I am slowly working on developing further, I have no final goal so I will continue to work on it sporadically until I think its reached a point I'm happy with.

So far:
- Drawing points in 3D Space with perspective
- Linking the points into lines
- Adding planes to make shapes
- Clipping lines and planes off-screen (kinda works)
- Draw order for planes (also kinda works)

Working on:
- Drawing planes in triangles
- Improving draw order and culling
- Adding other shapes than cuboids
